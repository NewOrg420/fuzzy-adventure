# Fuzzy Adventure

This repository contains a very small tool that acts as a lightweight alternative to Postman. Open `index.html` in your browser and you can define REST requests, store them in your browser's local storage and send them directly. Each request can also include custom headers.

## Usage

1. Open the file `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Fill in the request name, method, URL, optional headers and body.
3. Click **Save Request** to store it in local storage or **Send Request** to execute it.
4. Saved requests appear in the sidebar and can be loaded for reuse.

No external dependencies are required; everything works completely offline.
